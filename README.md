# Employee-Management-System
## Summary/Overview
In this assignment, I was challenged to create a command line application that manages a list of employees and their roles in a company. After running npm install, you can run `node index.js` at the root level and this will open the command line app. You are presented with a list of prompts and each one you select has an independently coded function.
